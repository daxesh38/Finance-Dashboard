# ðŸ’° Power BI Finance Dashboard

This project is a clean and professional **Finance Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. It includes insights on income, expenses, savings, and key financial metrics across months and years.

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

I followed a tutorial from [**The Developer**](https://www.youtube.com/@The-Developer-BI) YouTube channel to build this dashboard.  
During the project, I learned:
- How to use DAX functions like `PreviousMonth`, `RETURN`, and how to create variables using `VAR`.
- How to structure data and design a dashboard cleanly and simply.
- How to build page navigation and interactively filter data.
